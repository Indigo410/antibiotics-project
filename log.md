- updated module structure, demo usage contained in `usage.py`
- implemented `non_param_bootstrap` in test.py
- TODO:
    - Q: should metabolite also be randomly sampled in `non_param_bootstrap`?
    - test correlation metric functions
    - fix and update `joint_significance`
    - suppress unwanted print statement from imported module
---
- filled in code for `test_simulation.py`
- created `structure.md` to record planned package structure of `simulation`
- WIP:
    - tree similarity in `simulation.py`
- TODO:
    - validate the code for `test_simulation.py`
    - fix the not psd problem in `TreeSimilarity`
    - fill in `usage.ipynb`
---
- moved log of progress from `README.md`
- Simulation class work as expected
- WIP:
    - reformating the simulation and testing script
---
- removed incorrect multivariate simulation method, added update to
  the multivariate simulation
- WIP: restructuring mediation simulation into a class
- TODO: 
    - update verification script for the mediation simulation class
    - fix the carried over errors in the verification process
---

- updated B&K steps for mediation on simulated data
---
- added first draft of reimplementation of linear regression (linmodEst) from R.
- TODO: test `linReg.py`

---
- finished 1st draft of mediation_simulation in python
- test & validate if the python version matches with expected result (R)
    - OtuAnn and MetAnn output looks about right;
    - OTU & Metabolite fixed
- removed pandas dependency in the reimplementation
